set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```

**macOS/Linux**

```js
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```

## Run Your First Playwright Test

>**Test Scenario**: The sample playwright-single.js file search the term 'LambdaTest' on Bing.

Shown below are the steps on running Playwright tests on the LambdaTest platform. 

1. Clone the LambdaTest-Playwright GitHub repository and switch to the cloned directory.

```js
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample.git
cd playwright-sample
```

2. Ensure you have npm dependencies installed. 

3. Configure your LambdaTest authentication credentials.

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first Playwright test on LambdaTest. 

Check out [playwright-single.js](https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample/blob/main/playwright-single.js) file to view the sample test script.


4. Pass the below command to run the test.

```
node playwright-single.js
```

## View your Playwright test results

The LambdaTest Automation Dashboard is where you can see the results of your Playwright tests after running them on the LambdaTest platform. 

The below screenshot of LambdaTest Automation Dashboard shows the Playwright build on the left and the build sessions associated with the selected build on the right.

Shown below are the steps on running parallel tests with Playright on the LambdaTest platform. 

1. Clone the LambdaTest-Playwright GitHub repository and switch to the cloned directory.

```js
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample.git
cd playwright-sample
```

2. Ensure you have npm dependencies installed. 

3. Configure your LambdaTest authentication credentials.

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can run your parallel tests with Playwright on LambdaTest.

## Run Playwright Tests In Gitpod

Select the button below to try this demo in [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)

[<img alt="Run in Gitpod" width="200px" align="center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70570645/169987363-1408c494-4e2a-4f12-8828-c931eac716b0.png" />](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample)

* After the Gitpod session launches, navigate to the terminal and run the following commands to save your [LambdaTest Credentials](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) to Gitpod as environment variables:

```
eval $(gp env -e LT_USERNAME=******)
eval $(gp env -e LT_ACCESS_KEY=******)
  ```

* Click the following link if you're unsure how to [access your LambdaTest credentials.](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/using-environment-variables-for-authentication-credentials/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=playwright-sample). Also, if you start a new terminal in Gitpod, you have to run the following command to reset envrionment variables:
```
 eval $(gp env -e)
```
