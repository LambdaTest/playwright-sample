```

## View your Playwright test results

The LambdaTest Automation Dashboard is where you can see the results of your Playwright tests after running them on the LambdaTest platform. 

The below screenshot of LambdaTest Automation Dashboard shows the Playwright build on the left and the build sessions associated with the selected build on the right.
